## Test Structure

### Backend API Tests (Jest + Supertest)
```
tests/api/
├── auth.test.ts              # Authentication & role access
├── admin-panel.test.ts       # Admin panel functionality
├── transactions.test.ts      # Financial operations
└── reporting.test.ts         # Support ticket system
```

### Frontend E2E Tests (Playwright)
```
tests/e2e/
├── auth-flow.spec.ts         # Authentication workflows
├── admin-panel.spec.ts       # Admin panel UI testing
├── transactions.spec.ts      # Transaction flows
└── search-sync.spec.ts       # Search & synchronization
```

### Test Data & Helpers
```
tests/helpers/
├── testData.ts               # Mock user generation
├── seedData.ts               # Database seeding
└── authUtils.ts              # Authentication helpers
```

## Mock User Generation

The framework auto-generates test users with different roles:

```typescript
// Available test users (no manual creation needed)
const testUsers = {
  admin: { isAdmin: true, role: 'admin' },
  support: { isSupport: true, role: 'support' },
  verifiedCreator: { kycStatus: 'verified', role: 'creator' },
  basicUser: { kycStatus: 'pending', role: 'basic' },
  volunteer: { reliabilityScore: '4.8', role: 'volunteer' },
  tipper: { phpBalance: '25000.00', role: 'tipper' },
  flaggedUser: { isFlagged: true, accountStatus: 'limited' }
};
```

## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x run-tests.sh

# Run comprehensive test suite
./run-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Types
```bash
# Backend API tests only
npx jest tests/api/

# Frontend E2E tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/

# Specific test file
npx jest tests/api/auth.test.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/admin-panel.spec.ts
```

### Test Configuration
```bash
# Run with coverage
npx jest --coverage

# Run E2E tests with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Test Environment

### Database Setup
- Uses test database to avoid affecting production data
- Auto-seeds test data with all user roles and scenarios
- Cleans up after each test run

### Mock Authentication
- Bypasses external auth providers for testing
- Simulates all user roles and permission levels
- Maintains session state throughout test flows

### Payment Simulation
- Mocks PayMongo and payment processing
- Simulates successful and failed transactions
- Tests fee calculations without real charges

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   ```bash
   # Ensure DATABASE_URL is set for test environment
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/verifund_test"
   ```

2. **Server Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Check if port 5000 is available
   lsof -i :5000
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

3. **Test Data Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Reset database and reseed
   npm run db:push --force
   npm run test:seed-data
   ```

4. **Browser Tests Failing**
   ```bash
   # Install Playwright browsers
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Log Analysis
Check specific logs in `test-results/` directory:
- Backend API errors: `*-test.log`
- Frontend E2E errors: `*-e2e.log`
- Server startup: `server.log`
- Database setup: `db-setup.log`
