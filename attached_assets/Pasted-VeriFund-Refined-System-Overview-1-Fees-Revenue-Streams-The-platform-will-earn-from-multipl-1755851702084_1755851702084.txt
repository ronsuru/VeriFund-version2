VeriFund – Refined System Overview
💰 1. Fees & Revenue Streams

The platform will earn from multiple points, all visible and transparent:

Deposits

When users deposit PHP → converted to $PUSO.

Small fee (e.g., 1–2%) for maintaining fiat on/off ramp.

Contributions

Standard crowdfunding fee (e.g., 3–5%).

Deducted when funds are released to Pool Creator.

Tips

Lower fee (e.g., 1–2%) to encourage supporting creators.

Withdrawals

Flat or percentage fee (e.g., ₱20 or 1%) for sending PHP back to bank/e-wallet.

✅ This way, every financial action generates revenue for sustainability.

👩‍💻 2. Admin Panel Features

A secure backend dashboard accessible only by platform admins/staff.

Verification & Compliance

Community Management

Oversee volunteer matching system.

Financial Controls

Customer Support

Refund processing (manual overrides if needed).

🔗 3. Smart Contract + Off-chain Balance Flow

Because of fiat integration (PHP), the system is hybrid:

On-chain:

Pool contracts (holds $PUSO until claimable).

Tips contracts (direct to creators).

Reward/tokenomics distribution.

Off-chain (Admin-controlled):

Fiat gateway (PHP → $PUSO → PHP).

Admin overrides (refunds, fraud take-downs).

Database with user balances (mirroring on-chain $PUSO).

🛠 Example User Flow

User deposits ₱1,000 → charged ₱1,020 (₱20 fee).

Converted to $PUSO in backend wallet, shown as ₱1,000 balance.

User contributes ₱500 to a Pool → smart contract locks $PUSO equivalent. Fee applied when Creator withdraws.

User tips ₱200 to Creator → sent to Creator’s Tips Pool (fee deducted).

Creator withdraws ₱5,000 → receives ₱4,950 (₱50 withdrawal fee).

Admin monitors everything via Admin Panel (fraud flags, verifications, support tickets).

🎯 Value Added by Admin Panel

Prevents scams/frauds → trust in VeriFund.

Customer care → helps non-crypto-native users (since most will be PHP users).

Revenue & transparency tracking → ensures platform sustainability.

⚡With this setup, VeriFund looks like a Web2 crowdfunding platform with Web3 transparency — the blockchain ($PUSO on Celo) works invisibly behind the scenes, but admins keep order and users get simplicity.
