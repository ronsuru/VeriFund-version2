# VeriFund Admin Access - FIXED!

## Quick Access for Development

I've created a development route to easily access the admin panel:

**Step 1**: Visit this URL in your browser:
```
/api/dev/create-admin
```

**Step 2**: After clicking that link, you'll be automatically logged in as an admin user

**Step 3**: Navigate to the admin panel:
```
/admin
```

## What This Does
- Creates a test admin user with full permissions
- Automatically logs you in 
- Allows immediate access to test the Reports section and other admin features

## URLs to Access
1. **Create Admin & Login**: `http://localhost:5000/api/dev/create-admin`
2. **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:5000/admin` (after step 1)

## For Production
This development route should be removed before production deployment. The normal authentication flow would be:
- Login: `/api/login` 
- Admin Panel: `/admin` (after authentication)

## Ready to Test
You can now access the admin panel and test the Reports section that we've been working on!
